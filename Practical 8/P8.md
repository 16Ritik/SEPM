# Gym Management System - Test Suite Design

## Aim
To design and document a comprehensive set of test suites to validate the functionalities of the Gym Management System, ensuring that all modules perform as expected and meet user requirements.

## Theory
A test suite is a collection of test cases intended to thoroughly examine the correctness, performance, and security of a software system. In a Gym Management System, various features like user registration, membership management, trainer scheduling, billing, and attendance tracking need to be tested under different conditions.

Test suites are divided into functional and non-functional categories and cover positive, negative, boundary, and edge test cases.
